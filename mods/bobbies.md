## Bobbie’s Modded Desktop Goose Tutorial with Visuals

* First download the mod

* Then extract the file. (A folder will appear, click on it.)

![You should see the following files appear inside the GooseSoundControl Folder: Assets, Changelog, Config, Read me! Honk, and Goose Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tatohead/ResourceHub-Images/patch-1/Bobbie%E2%80%99s%20Modded%20Desktop%20Goose/part%201.png "You should see the following files appear inside the GooseSoundControl Folder: Assets, Changelog, Config, Read me! Honk, and Goose Desktop")

* Open the config file in Notepad

![There are 4 lines in that notepad that says: PressFToHonk=True, RainbowGoose=False, CustomGooseColorEnabled=True, and CustomGooseColorHexCode=#90EE90](https://github.com/Tatohead/ResourceHub-Images/blob/patch-1/Bobbie%E2%80%99s%20Modded%20Desktop%20Goose/part%202.png?raw=true "There are 4 lines in that notepad that says: PressFToHonk=True, RainbowGoose=False, CustomGooseColorEnabled=True, and CustomGooseColorHexCode=#90EE90")

Below is a chart that should tell you what kind of setting are there in your config file. Function will tell you what happens if you were to manipulate that setting,

| Setting                   | Function                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Version=                  | Changing it will corrupt the file                                                                        |
| MinWanderingTimeSeconds=  | Shortest amount time before Goose does an action (Memes/Notes/Mud/Attack/Gifts)                          |
| MaxWanderingTimeSeconds=  | Longest amount time before Goose does an action (Memes/Notes/Mud/Attack/Gifts)                           |
| FirstWanderTimeSeconds=   | When the Goose first appears, amount time before goose does an action (Memes/Notes/Mud/Attack/Gifts)     |
| PressFToHonk=             | If pressing the [F] key will make the goose Honk                                                         |
| RainbowGoose=             | If the Goose will change colors (Make CustomGooseColorEnabled= set to False) **⚠️Warning:** This will likely trigger seizure for those who may be photosensitive epilepsy. Take caution before changing the settings       |
| CustomGooseColorEnabled=  | If you can set the Goose's body color to one color                                                       |
| CustomGooseColorHexCode=  | Determines the color of the Goose's body (See Further Below for Color Table)                             |

* Remember to save your Config file
