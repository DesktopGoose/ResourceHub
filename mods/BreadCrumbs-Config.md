This mod was originally created by eundeas.  This is essentially the same thing but with a config.

This mod allows you to feed the goose to make him walk across your screen, or to calm him down when he is in a frenzy. Plus he makes cute nom sound.

Usage: Change config to whatever keybind you want.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8
