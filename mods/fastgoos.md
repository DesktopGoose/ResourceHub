## Fastgoos Tutorial with Visuals

This mod allows you to have your goose move really fast.

* First download the fastgoos mod

The file should say "fastgoos_with_loader.zip" when you download it

![The mods folder, three load bin files, and a run with mods.bats file should be in the same area as where the DesktopGoose.exe is placed along with your Assets folder.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tatohead/ResourceHub-Images/master/Fastgoos/part%201.png "The mods folder, three load bin files, and a run with mods.bats file should be in the same area as where the DesktopGoose.exe is placed along with your Assets folder.")

* Delete the config file

* Then run the 'run with mods.bat' that you see above

* Then exit that program

* Open up the newly created config file

What you should see the last 2 lines the same on that notepad (Do not worry about the other configuration settings on that notepad):

![The following 2 lines should be seen in your newly created config file: FastGoos.TimeMultiplier=5 and FastGoos.RealTimeMultiplier=0.75](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tatohead/ResourceHub-Images/master/Fastgoos/part%202.png "The following 2 lines should be seen in your newly created config file: FastGoos.TimeMultiplier=5 and FastGoos.RealTimeMultiplier=0.75")

The following is the effect 

Below is a chart that should tell you what kind of setting are added in your config file. Function will tell you what happens if you were to manipulate that setting,

| Setting                              | Function                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| FastGoos.TimeMultiplier= | How fast the goose will move by # time compared to the original speed |
| FastGoos.RealTimeMultiplier= | How often the goose will do an action (affects length of pauses in between) |

* Remember to save the Config file's changes

* Run the 'run with mods.bat' file once more and you're done!

**Notice:** If you run the DesktopGoose.exe you will end up corrupting the file. You should be running with 'run with mods.bat' everytime. If the file does get corrupted, delete the config file and make new one using the 'run with mods.bat' again. Otherwise you may have to startover.

**Note:** Also it can take a while for the goose to show up if you are using certain mods. You can still press esc to exit the program.
